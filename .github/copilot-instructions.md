# Copilot Instructions

# Project Overview
This project is a modern, responsive portfolio and cover letter site built with Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases professional experience, tech stack, and projects in a modular, data-driven, and easily customizable format.

# Project Structure
- `src/pages/index.astro`: Main entry page, composes the site from modular React components.
- `src/components/`: UI sections (Header, Developer, TechStack, Experience, Projects, Footer, Terminal).
- `src/constants/Constants.ts`: Centralized data for sections, tech stack, companies, projects, and social links.
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro`: HTML layout, global styles, and theme logic (light/dark mode).
- `src/assets/`: Images and icons for branding and content.
- `src/styles/global.css`: Tailwind and custom CSS variables.
- `public/`: Static files (e.g., favicon).

# Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all logic and data files.
- Use React functional components for UI in `.tsx` files.
- Use Astro components for page composition and layout.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling; custom properties are defined in `global.css`.
- Centralize all static data in `src/constants/Constants.ts`.
- Use interfaces from `src/types/types.ts` for type safety.
- Follow ESLint rules as defined in `eslint.config.js` (e.g., prefer const, no unused vars, accessibility rules).
- Use strict TypeScript settings as per `tsconfig.json`.

# Best Practices
- Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use data-driven patterns: map over arrays from constants to render UI.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use semantic HTML and ensure accessibility (a11y) compliance.
- Use dark/light theme logic as implemented in `Layout.astro`.
- Store images and icons in the appropriate `assets/` subfolders.
- Use descriptive, consistent naming for files, variables, and components.

# Copilot Instructions
- Generate code that matches the project's structure and conventions above.
- Do NOT generate markdown files that inform about what the agent did or describe agent actions.
- When generating new files, prefer TypeScript, React, or Astro files as appropriate.
- For new sections or features, follow the modular, data-driven, and type-safe patterns used in the project.
- For styles, use Tailwind CSS classes and reference custom properties from `global.css`.
- For new data, extend `src/constants/Constants.ts` and update types in `src/types/types.ts`.
- Ensure all code is accessible and responsive.

# Example Patterns
- To add a new section, create a new React component in `src/components/`, add its data to `Constants.ts`, and import it in `index.astro`.
- To add a new tech or project, update the relevant array in `Constants.ts`.
- For icons/images, add to `src/assets/` and import as needed.

# Restrictions
- Do NOT create markdown files that describe or inform about agent actions or what was generated by the agent.
- Do NOT generate documentation files unless explicitly requested.
